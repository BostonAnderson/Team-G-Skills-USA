        <h2>Who we are?</h2>
    
        <p>Nonprofit Legal Services of Utah is a new kind of law firm.  We are a nonprofit organization with a two part mission: <br><br> First, we seek to fulfill the legal needs of people who do not qualify for free legal assistance but are still locked out of the legal system as a result of the exorbitant fees charged by most attorneys in private practice. <br><br> 

            Second, we aim to provide excellent and cost-effective counsel and representation to the nonprofit community in Utah, a large portion of which cannot obtain the advice it needs due to the ever-expanding costs associated with hiring an attorney.
